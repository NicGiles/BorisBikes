# Boris Bikes Coding Challenge

Makers Academy coding challenge week 1.

Build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on).

## Focus goals

Mindful engagement with these challenges can help you achieve these goals:

- _I write code that is easy to change_

  - Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.

- _I can test-drive my code_

  - Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.

- _I can build with objects_

  - Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.

- _I know how my language works_
  - Understanding your language is important because it helps you reason and communicate about software effectively. This makes your teams more effective, and most software is made by teams.
